# Parameters for the Eureka server, prefixed with eureka.server.

# The last two parameters used for the Eureka server, waitTimeInMsWhenSyncEmpty and

# We also want trace and span IDs to be written to logs; this will enable us to correlate log output from

# We can include the trace and span IDs in the log output by specifying the following log format:
# With the above log format, the log output will look like:
