# Configuration for using Micrometer Tracing and Zipkin is added to the configuration file, config-repo/*.yml.
# In the default profile, it is specified that trace information will be sent to Zipkin using the following URL.

# By default, Micrometer Tracing only sends 10% of the traces to Zipkin. To ensure that all traces are

# We also want trace and span IDs to be written to logs; this will enable us to correlate log output from
# cooperating microservices that, for example, fulfill a request sent to the external API.
# We can include the trace and span IDs in the log output by specifying the following log format:
# With the above log format, the log output will look like:

# Whenever a microservice instance needs to be stopped, for example, in a rolling upgrade scenario, there is a
# risk that active requests are affected when the instance is stopped. To minimize this risk, Spring Boot has
# added support for graceful shutdown. When applying graceful shutdown, a microservice stops accepting new requests
# and waits for a configurable time for active requests to complete before it shuts down the application.
# Requests that take a longer time to complete than the shutdown wait period will be aborted.
# These requests will be seen as exceptional cases that a shutdown procedure can’t wait for before it stops
# the application. Graceful shutdown has been enabled with a waiting period of 10 seconds for all microservices
# by adding the following to the common file application.yml in the config-repo folder.
